loginsystem
===========

The purpose of this class is to give programmers a easy to use package with login, registration and password management 
that is easy to implement in current projects.

Currently login is working and registration. Change password has not been fully implemented yet but is on it's way.
The goal is to make this as generic as possible but still be secure.
